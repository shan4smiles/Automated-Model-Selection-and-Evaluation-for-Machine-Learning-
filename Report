### Summary

1. **Imports and Setup**:
   - The script begins by importing necessary libraries for data manipulation (`pandas`, `numpy`), model training (`sklearn`), and Bayesian Optimization (`bayes_opt`).
   - A random seed is set for reproducibility of results.

2. **Loading Data**:
   - The `load_data` function is defined to load a dataset from a file (CSV or Excel). If the file type is unsupported, it returns an error.

3. **Classification or Regression**:
   - The `is_classification` function checks whether the target variable `y` is suitable for classification. If `y` is categorical or has fewer than 20 unique values, it is classified as a classification problem.

4. **Model Optimization**:
   - **Classification Models**:
     - The `optimize_classification_models` function performs the following steps:
       - It splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
       - Feature scaling is applied using `StandardScaler` to normalize the input features.
       - Several models are defined (SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting) with corresponding functions for hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian Optimization.
       - Each model's hyperparameters are optimized based on accuracy through 10-fold cross-validation.
       - After optimization, the best hyperparameters are used to train each model on the training set.
       - The models are then evaluated on the test set, and the model with the highest accuracy is selected.

   - **Regression Models**:
     - The `optimize_regression_models` function similarly splits the data and scales the features. However, it focuses solely on Linear Regression.
     - It evaluates the model using mean squared error (MSE) through cross-validation and calculates the test set MSE.

5. **Data Processing**:
   - The script reads a dataset called `phish.csv`, assumes the last column is the target variable (`y`), and the remaining columns are features (`X`).
   - It checks if the task is classification or regression and calls the respective optimization function.

6. **Prediction**:
   - At the end of the script, it uses the best model found to make predictions on a predefined set of features.

### Execution Flow

- Load the dataset.
- Determine the type of task (classification or regression).
- Optimize and evaluate the best model.
- Print results including the best model name, cross-validated accuracy (for classification) or MSE (for regression), and make a prediction using a specified feature set.
